# Spotify Downloader Project

So I created this simple to use Spotify Downloader project to help people who wish to convert from Spotify due to their harmful policies or just like hoarding music like I do

It has the capability to download playlist, albums & tracks regardless of if you have a Spotify account or not. Quite simple to run, configure & understand, the only requirements is that you have spotdl installed but no worries the downloader can install it for you
However the downloader supports the highest version of the spotdl library (currently 4.4.3 right now) which is available with Python versions 3.13.11 or less, so it best you use it
Otherwise have fun with the program. 

& Thank you for support. I am currently working on a GUI version so stay updated

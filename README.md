# Spotify Downloader Project

So I created this simple to use Spotify Downloader project to help people who wish to convert from Spotify due to their harmful policies or just like hoarding music like I do

It has the capability to download playlist, albums & tracks regardless of if you have a Spotify account or not. Quite simple to run, configure & understand, the only requirements is that you have spotdl installed but no worries the downloader can install it for you

However the downloader supports the highest version of the spotdl library (currently 4.4.3 right now) which is available with Python versions 3.13.11 or less, so it best you have a version of Python below 3.14 installed

There are two files in this repo:
- base_downloader : A basic downloader that downloads links in a text file. Simple and easy to understand.
- interactive_downloader: Has more functionality than the base downloader, can work with or without a Spotify account
- gui_downloader: Provides a User interface for the interactive downloader (done with QtPy5)
- web_downloader: Connects downloader to the web using Flask (coming soon)

Each file has comments to help out with understanding the process behind the program. 

Thank you for support. I am currently working on a GUI version so stay updated, otherwise have fun with the program. 

Small Note: If you experience any issues with the program, message, email for solutions
